# name_route_demo

A Demo Name Route Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is my ways of how to use Name Route point for a Flutter application.

Check the main.dart how the initial route of app is setup along with name route passing arguments (line 40 of main.dart).

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
